# Supply-Chain-KPI-Dashboard
# ABC Shipping Logistics – Supply Chain Optimization (Demo Project)

> This is a simulated dashboard project created for portfolio/demo purposes.
> All data and visuals are synthetic and inspired by a real-world project I contributed to. Due to confidentiality, exact business data and details have been omitted.

##  Objective
To optimize supply chain operations using data-driven techniques and enhance operational visibility for better logistics decision-making.

## Tools & Technologies
- SQL (for querying and cleaning mock shipment data)
- Tableau (for dashboard design and visualization)
- Python (for data wrangling and forecasting simulations)

## Key Features
- Mock dashboard showcasing:
  - Real-time shipment tracking by mode and status
  - Carrier performance summary (on-time %, delay reasons)
  - Shipment trend analysis and delays visualization
- Data simulation mimicking over 40,000 shipment records
- SQL-based data exploration driving key metrics
